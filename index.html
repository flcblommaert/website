  <h3>Original proposal</h3>
  <p>For my final project for ‘Digital Detectives: Detective Literature Under a Digital Macroscope’ I want to analyse how the articles written about lust murders have changed over time. The growing awareness around sexual harassment and sexual assault explains the specification for lust murders. Maybe a beginning of this awareness can be found within the stylistic changes. 
As a corpus I would use newspaper articles from American newspapers. I haven’t yet decided on if I want to use articles from only one newspaper or several newspapers. Wardle (2007) did a similar study on narrative changes in American and British newspaper articles on child murder and for his literature to be as supportive as possible it would be useful to adopt a part of his methodology.
The corpus would consist of two sub corpora (Wardle (2007) uses three): articles published in the 1930s and articles published in the 1990s. One way to compare the two sub corpora would be to identify distinctive vocabulary using either TD-IDF or Dunning’s Log Likelihood (described in the powerpoint of February 12th).  I am not exactly sure about the visualizations that could be used. There would be two options: a visualization about one stylistic era (1930s) or a visualization that shows a comparison between two stylistic eras (1930s vs 1900s).
Another point of discussion would be if this topic is fitting enough for a course that is build around the subject of detective stories. Although the topic may be different I hope it can still showcase things we learned during the lectures and will therefore be an allowed final project for this course. </p>
